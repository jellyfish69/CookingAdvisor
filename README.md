# CookingAdvisor
This app was created for suggesting recipes using either a local SQL database or an API.

For the local SQL database to suggest any recipes, the user has to enter three available ingredients.

This app was created during my college years, while struggling to find what to cook having only some ingredients at any given time.

Are you a student and don't know what to cook today? This app might be ideal for you.

Important note #1:

The database needs to be updated. Only a few recipes were included for testing.
